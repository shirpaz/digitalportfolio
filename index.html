                            <h4>Internship at The Coding School</h4>
                            <p class="subline">
                                During my internship at The Coding School, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that helped me develop my skills in web design and development. One of the most exciting projects was revamping the website, creating visuals, and course bundle promotions for the Coding School's website.
                                <br /><br />
                                The project involved UI/UX web design, graphics, and creating promotional course bundles. I began by researching current marketing trends and studying the existing marketing strategies of the company and its local and international competitors. I wanted to create visuals that would be eye-catching, modern, and aligned with the company's branding.
                                <br /><br />
                                Once I had a clear vision for the website, I started the design process. Using a combination of Figma, Shopify Applications, HTML, and CSS code, I created mockups to showcase my design concepts. Throughout the process, I collaborated closely with the web development team to ensure that my designs were feasible and would integrate seamlessly with the existing website.
                                <br /><br />
                                I also created graphics using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva. I developed templates for various social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, and designed banners, images, and other graphics to promote the course bundles.
                                <br /><br />
                                Analyzing the target market, their interests, and preferences allowed me to develop a marketing strategy that would appeal to them. Through this project, I learned about the importance of creating cohesive visuals that align with a company's branding and a user-friendly website, especially since most of the users are parents.
                                <br /><br />
                                Working with the web development team taught me the importance of collaboration and communication in web development. It helped me understand how design decisions can impact the functionality of a website and how to work with others to achieve a common goal.
                                <br /><br />
                                The final product was a visually stunning website that showcased the best of The Coding School's services and capabilities. I was proud to have played a part in its creation and felt that the experience had greatly enhanced my skills in web design and development.
                                <br /><br />
                                In conclusion, the project of designing visuals and creating course bundle promotions for The Coding School was an invaluable learning opportunity that allowed me to develop my skills in web design and marketing. The experience taught me about the importance of creating cohesive visuals and developing effective marketing strategies in a real-world setting. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project and believe that it has prepared me well for future endeavors in web development.

                                                <p class="subline">
                                                    As a college student, I have learned a great deal about myself and the world around me. One of the most important lessons I have learned during my college life is that failure is not the end. In fact, I have learned that failure is a necessary step towards success. Each time I have failed, I have learned something new, and this has helped me become a better person.
                                                    <br /><br />
                                                    Another thing that I have discovered during my college years is my career goals. I have come to realize that I want to work in a company that has a meaningful impact. I am passionate about making a positive difference in the world, and I want my work to reflect this. Additionally, I have discovered my love for UI/UX design, and I hope to pursue a career in this field.
                                                    <br /><br />
                                                    During my college years, I have also discovered my personal preference for working from home. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of us to adapt to remote work, and I have found that I am more productive when working from home. I enjoy the flexibility and freedom that comes with working remotely, and I hope to continue this lifestyle in the future.
                                                    <br /><br />
                                                    Finally, I have made some commitment statements for myself during college. One of my goals is to gain more skills that will help me succeed in my career. I believe that learning never ends, and I want to continue to grow and develop my skills even after I graduate.
                                                    <br /><br />
                                                    Overall, my college life has been a time of great personal growth and discovery. I have learned so much about myself, my goals, and my preferences, and I am excited to see where these experiences will take me in the future. I am grateful for the lessons I have learned and the people I have met along the way, and I know that these memories will stay with me for a lifetime.

                                                Reflecting on my experience in the program, I am filled with a sense of gratitude for the invaluable skills and knowledge that I have gained. One of the program's greatest strengths was the PRACPREP, which proved incredibly useful for job interviews and job hunting. Through this program, I acquired the necessary tools to present myself professionally and excel in job interviews, giving me a competitive edge in the job market. Additionally, the program equipped me with the skills and knowledge to be an asset in any workplace, preparing me well for the challenges and demands of the professional world. Furthermore, the program also assisted me in finding the right company that would best utilize my set of skills and strengths, helping me to match my aspirations with the right career path.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                However, despite the program's many strengths, I also encountered some weaknesses during my time in the program. One of the biggest challenges was the fact that most of the accredited companies did not qualify for the OJT requirements, as they required purely remote work. This presented a hurdle for me as I was hoping to gain practical experience in a physical workplace. Additionally, most of the accredited companies were not hiring during the ISP practicum, which limited the opportunities available for practical experience. Despite these challenges, I remained committed to making the most out of my experience.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                One particular subject that proved to be incredibly valuable during the ISP curriculum was teamwork and problem-solving. This skillset was put to the test during my internship, where I encountered numerous challenges that required effective communication and collaboration with my team. Through this experience, I learned the importance of working well with others, giving constructive feedback, and inspiring people to do their best. I also learned the importance of being flexible in my thinking and operating style, having patience when dealing with others, and caring about the project outcome.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                As a result of this experience, I was able to develop several skills that have proven to be invaluable in my personal and professional life. These skills include teamwork, problem solving, constructive feedback, encouraging and inspiring people, and humor. Furthermore, I also learned to be aware that some team members are not as capable as I am, which helped me to become a better collaborator and mentor for my co-interns.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                Overall, I am extremely proud of the tasks and works that I completed during my time in the company. This experience has allowed me to grow both professionally and personally, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned and developed these valuable skills. Moving forward, I am confident that the skills and knowledge that I have acquired will enable me to achieve great things in my career and make a positive impact in the workplace.
